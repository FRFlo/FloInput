## Credits

This resource was partially created by [Eki](https://github.com/Ekinoxx0) for his own server.
I decided to remake everything from scratch and add some features.

**Edit:** Figured out the code used by the french developer is a resource by [@Mietek](https://forum.cfx.re/u/mmleczek), the original resource is [here](https://github.com/mmleczek/mmkeyboard-lua).

## Features
* Lightweight library.
* Event-based callbacks.
* Support for all screen resolutions.
* Fully customizable input box.
* Support for password inputs.
* Number limit for number inputs.
* Text length limit for text inputs.
* Add your own placeholders.
* Support for default values.
* Cool design.
